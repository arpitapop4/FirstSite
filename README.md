# FirstSite
My first website using pure HTML and CSS.

This is just a simple old-school website sample I created using vanilla HTML & CSS. This is an addition to my new websites-I-built-portfolio building. You can use the code as it is available publically for use in your own projects as well. It can be used as a good reference for newbies and college students who have just begun programming.
Cheers!
